  - #IDEAS: The base ideas we are working with.
    - #IMAGINE
        - IMAGINE: we plant #IDEAS
        - IMAGINE: we become #SEEDS to those #IDEAS
        - IMAGINE: we sow the world with those #SEEDS

        - IMAGINE: we finally find the #COURAGE needed
        - IMAGINE: we THE #IDEAS born from #IMAGINATION

        - IMAGINE: we are no longer afraid of #FEAR
        - IMAGINE: we #DRAW, #PAINT, #SING, #WRITE, #CREATE 'Reality'

        - IMAGINE: #INFORMATION is #KNOWLEDGE
        - IMAGINE: #KNOWLEDGE is #POWER
        - IMAGINE: the #SYSTEM built upon #INFORMATION, #KNOWLEDGE, and #POWER.

        - IMAGINE: we all synchronize to act in #HARMONY
        - IMAGINE: we thank all of Creation,
        - IMAGINE: this "#IDEA" goes #VIRAL.
        - #IMAGINE...

    - #CREATE
        - NOTE: Don't expect to 'evolve the #WORLD' until you have #EVOLVED
                yourself. The practice does not need quantity but #QUALITY

        - NOTE: TEN #PEOPLE WHO KNOW WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN A MILLION
                ARMED #ANARCHISTS.

        - STOP: being a #PASSIVE #USER
        - STOP: feeding negativity into your life: that which you feed, grows.
        - START: being an #ACTIVE #PROGRAMMER
        - START: becoming an #IMAGINATION #ARTIST

        - USE: your #IMAGINATION and #CREATIVITY


        - STOP: poisoning your mind with bad news/TV/outlooks/etc. We ALL
        know the world is pretty messed up, yeah, but tuning your brain into
        that sort of negativity is going to help #NOBODY.

        - START: feeding Consciousness, Beauty and Truth within yourself, towards
        the people closest to you and then into the world.

        The shortest and most powerful way to create from #ILLUSION into #REALITY
        is to see #BEAUTY all around you and within yourself, all the timE.

        #LOVE things and persons for what they are, JUST THE WAY THEY ARE, and
        not for what they "look like".

        Once you have done this, you'll be #FREE to decide which kind of things
        you would like to SEE CHANGING.

        The shortest and most powerful way to get there is #CREATE the energy
        all around you and within yourself, all the time.

        - FEEL: the #BEAUTY

        - SHARE: your #EXPERIENCES and #CREATIONS with #OTHERS: this is the single
        MOST important skill of the #IMAGINATION #ARTIST. #SHARE #CREATIONS with #OTHERS.

        - CREATE: the #SEEDS of something #BEAUTIFUL:
          - a wallpaper
          - a stencil
          - a game
          - a video
          - a message to the #FUTURE
          - #YOU are completely #FREE to choose what to #CREATE.

        - KNOW: that you can begin to Create:
          - YOU: have the #TOOLS and #CREATIVITY that you need
          - PASSION: to #CREATE and #SHARE beauty with the #WORLD
          - YOU: don't need to do "big" things
          - YOU: just have to START NOW.

        - WILL: to become a #REALITY #CREATOR by #ACTIVELY #CREATING your
        transformation from a #PASSIVE #USER to an #ACTIVE #ARTIST of #REALITY.

        - LASTLY: do NOT Keep #SILENT anymore: #SHARE the #EXPERIENCE that
        you have #LIVED and the #BEAUTY that you have #CREATED.

        - WHEN: you have found yourself, you will Find The Others.
        - WHEN: you have found The Others, you will find yourself.

        - DONOT: try to "convince" others
        - DONOT: WORRY ABOUT "results"

        - YOU: Keep injecting Beauty, with the obsessiveness, patience
               and commitment of a warrior. AT YOUR OWN PACE with 0% effort, but
               don't PUSH it.

        - RULE: if it #FEELS #CORRECT keep moving forward. Otherwise, #TEST
                something different.

        - OBSERVE: funny "coincidences" or strong synchronicities
          - OR: interesting people that suddenly appear in your life
          - OR: even soulmates that you begin to attract to yourself
          - LAUGH: about them, after all, the Universe might just be a big #JOKE

        - IGNORE: "opposition" or "defiance" to "prove" your newly found "powers"
          - KEEP: ON #SHINING
          - KEEP: ON #CREATING
          - KEEP: ON #SHARING

        - IGNORE: the external and internal "demons" (doubts, fears and disbeliefs)
          - YOU: realize they will soon #VANISH into thin air.

        - SHOW: #COURAGE and #COMMITMENT to your #PATH
          - BE: 120% sure that if you #CREATE this with all your #MIND, #BODY,
                #SOUL #NATURE will #REMOVE #IMPOSSIBLE #OBSTACLES.

        - TRUST: Don't trust us or believe us: #TEST it for #YOURSELF.

        - REMEMBER: #NEVER do anything #ILLEGAL and/or against your own #CONSCIOUSNESS.

        1. #QUESTION #EVERYTHING
          - don't just believe anything you read on this site, past, present or future.
        2. #TEST
          - Test your assumptions.
        3. #LAUGH
          - Laugh about results.

      - Developed for
        1. Brainstorming your #IDEAS
        2. Developing your #CREATIVE #THINKING
        3. Enhancing your #MIND
        4. Manifesting #IDEAS into #REALITY

      - CHALLENGE: for #EVERYONE to #COLLABORATE and #BRAINSTORM #CREATIVE #IDEAS.
      - AVOID: stalling, we won't aim at 'perfection'. Everything is OK!

      - PROBLEM: Any big problem is only a #METAPROBLEM
        - a problem about solving problems
        - a Microcosm #SPIRAL that mimics the growth of a Macrocosmic #SPIRAL.

      - SOLUTION: 'Almost good enough' might be MORE than a 'good enough' mentality.
        - Less Syntactics, More Semantics.

      - NOTE: We don't aim to find the 'best' solution, as there might be
      infinite ways to achieve a single goal.

  - #PHASES: The phases of development
    - A: #DUMMIES
      - MAKE: a FOR-DUMMIES edition of
        - IDEA: #IMAGINE
        - IDEA: #CREATE
        - NOTE: These versions would be as if they were being explained to a five
        year old. By making a video/text explaining them in the simplest form
        possible.

      - MAKE: Develop Information Messages from previous MAKE.
        - YOUTUBE: Comments, Replies, Videos
        - BLOGS: Writing Blog entries
        - TWITTER: Craft Tweets messages and devise Schedule.
        - INSTAGRAM: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
        - OTHER: Any other #UNKNOWN networks

    - B: #MESSENGERS
        - WHEN: the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist
                #FAMILY and #FREIENDS inviting them to observe/watch these messages.

          - NOTE: Trolling could be detrimental to the messages let’s avoid trolling
          and rather convey the message by a large number of individuals sharing
          at a time until the message is completed.

          To make this process easier the message could be started on subjects
          that are already prone to the idea.

          After this, the message may be easier to reach people with the most
          followers. Let’s spread the message everywhere.

    - C: #ENGAGEMENT
      - WHEN: both the #MESSENGERS and the #MESSAGES are ready
        1. An awareness marathon will start with #MESSENGERS posting the
           previously prepared (general public) messages.

        2. #MESSENGERS could
          - replace their normal profile with the a #BANNER
          - use the common #HASHTAGS
          - encouraged to publicize the #MESSAGES

        3. The message should be crystal clear as well as the intentions

  - #WHO: are the Artists
    - Someone who excels at #IMAGINATION
    - Someone who excels at #CURIOSITY
    - Someone who has a #PASSION and follows it no matter what others say, think or do.
    - Someone who #CREATES worlds that other people inhabit.
    - Someone who fights for The Good, The Beautiful and The Just.
    - Someone who shares for the love of sharing.
    - Someone who shines at influencing persons, systems, ideas and beliefs.
    - Someone who leaves the world a better place.
    - Someone who obsessively pursues a #TARGET until its final consequences
    - Someone who absolutely never never ever gives up.
    - Someone who does much with so little.

  - #ORGANIZING: Here is The Formula for a self-organizing society
    1. FIND: knowledge.
    2. PRESENT: this knowledge in a beautiful way.
    3. GIVE: others the power to do something with this knowledge.

    - NOTE: These three ingredients will create organic change. As each person is
    educated to the truth, they will share it with others, and they will all act
    on this truth in a beautiful way. Thus, beauty and truth will multiply.

  - #MEMES:
    - FIND: #MEMES
    - CREATE: #MEMES

    - NOTE: Memes like to be both literal and figurative. Many people can’t get
    past the literal interpretation in order to understand the deeper, hidden
    meanings in the allegory. As with the memes of the ancients, the memes of
    today also have deeper meanings.

  As the #IDEAS spread, and evolve, more people will become immersed in the #IDEAS
  you create. In this way, a new reality, a new society, a new universe can be
  built up from the very foundations of your #IMAGINATION.

  Through practice the individual is taught and trained to visualize themselves
  into a new #CREATIVE #FUTURE.

  As the #IDEAS develop much like a self-organizing system. The #IDEA will
  connect to its immediate environment through #FAMILY, #FRIENDS, and #SOCIAL
  Networks. Thus organizing the surrounding environment to suit THE POSITIVE END.

  The #IDEA is within us, and all around us; it can be disguised as anything,
  and everything. In a way, to participate in the #IDEA, is like experiencing a
  living story, where the universe #BUILDS itself around the #IDEA.

  The #IDEA is thus a living, breathing, entity... an experience, a mystery, a
  mythology, a new reality. The #IDEA is a Thought of Awakening.

  It is the only story worth telling; the only story that has ever been told,
  the story of #ETERNITY.

  To draw, paint, sculpt, design, write, act, sing and dance the #IDEA into
  existence. It will be through #US that the event takes place; for this #IDEA
  consumes all reality within itself; this object is an #IDEA, not a physical
  object, which draws all things towards itself.

  - #PROCTOCOLS
    - NOTE: We want to be copied because we believe that there is no limit to
    how many #IDEAS there can be in the #WORLD. Below are some instructions on
    how we did it. Of course, there is a multitude of other ways to do it. We
    want to share our experiences.

    1. Throw a party with friends. Cook some food if you like, bring laptops,
    play music, or if you do not have a place to entertain, find a pub or internet
    cafe that you can meet in and bring your laptops too.

    2. Gather friends with various skills. You will need coders, philosophers,
    people who know politics and people who know Photoshop.

      - NOTE: Make sure your friends know also how to have fun, since otherwise
      you won't get anything done. #IDEAS are not rocket science, so just spread
      out skills.

    3. Become friends with important people. Contact politicians, bureaucrats,
    presidents, corporations, other activists, hackers, artists, etc.

      - NOTE: Do not have principles for selecting beforehand whom you speak to.
      Build trust, and make sure you work together.

    4. Throw more #PARTIES

    5. Invent vocabularies.
      - MAKE: #MUSIC together even if it is strange
      - MAKE: #ART together even if it is strange
      - MAKE: #POETRY together even if it is strange
      - MAKE: #REALITY together even if it is strange

    6. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points, in the event that
    you have to "present" on the fly. Make sure that you have a few easy-to
    remember facts to back up your statements.

      - NOTE: Statements are not only for stating things. Statements also makes
      things harder to forget. By sending out messages of events, activities and
      other tips you make them unforgettable and eternal.

    7. Remember to smile. Just, never be sad in general.

    8. Create a #GIANT #Twitter network.

      - NOTE: Whenever you tweet something, have people retweet it, and ask their
      friends to retweet it. Always strive for deep tweets. Get in the habit of
      making your tweets very descriptive but concise, so people do not have to
      click a link to know if they are interested or not.

    9. Don't be obsessed with doing things "right".

      - NOTE: Instead of thinking too much, tinker instead. Proceed by way of
      experimentation, try things out. If they fail, make sure to laugh a little,
      then try a different way.

    10. Learn from the mistakes.

    11. Share all knowledge freely with others.

    12. Totally go for it fearlessly, while sparking and nurturing collective
    inspired creative inventions and spontaneous depths of strategic #FUN.

    13. Do not be afraid to appear temporarily foolish.

    14. Talk to people where ever you go, and tell them about what you are doing.

    15. Be open with everything you do.

    16. Love your friends. Without them, everything fails.

    17. Become friends with people in mainstream media.

    18. Transform into the #RealityArtist you know you were meant to be.
