    - #IMAGINE
        - IMAGINE: an #IDEA
        - IMAGINE: actually having a real #IDEA
        - IMAGINE: actually doing something with that #IDEA

        - IMAGINE: the first real #IDEA you just had.
        - IMAGINE: bringing the #IDEA into #REALITY is going to be hard.
        - IMAGINE: it will take #WORK

        - IMAGINE: finding the #TIME needed to compelte the #IDEA
        - IMAGINE: not making excuses for NOT compeleting the #IDEA

        - IMAGINE: non-programmers have more ideas.
        - IMAGINE: we than the programmers for writing our instructions.

        - IMAGINE: We learn how to talk to eachother.
        - just #IMAGINE...

  - #STEPS: The steps of development
    - A: #DUMMIES
      - MAKE: a FOR-DUMMIES edition of #IDEA
        - NOTE: This version would be as if they were being explained to a five
        year old. By making a video/text explaining them in the simplest form
        possible.

    - B: #MESSENGERS
        - WHEN: the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist
        #FAMILY and #FREIENDS inviting them to observe/watch the #IDEA.

        - NOTE: To make this process easier the message could be started on subjects
        that are already prone to the idea.

    - C: #ENGAGEMENT
      - WHEN: both the #MESSENGERS and the #IDEA are ready an awareness
      marathon will start with #MESSENGERS posting the previously prepared
      (general public) messages.

      #MESSENGERS could:
        - replace their normal profile with the a #BANNER
        - use common #HASHTAGS
        - encouraged to #SHARE the #IDEA

      - NOTE: The message should be crystal clear as well as the intentions

  - #WHO: are the NonProgrammers
    - SOMEONE: who asks meaningless Questions.
    - SOMEONE: who is consntatly off Topic.
    - SOMEONE: who has a #PASSION for wasting time.
    - SOMEONE: blames everyone for their problems.
    - SOMEONE: watches Evil triumph
    - SOMEONE: who doesn't #SHARE anything.
