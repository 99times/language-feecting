  - #IDEA: Have an #IDEA
    - #IMAGINE
        - IMAGINE: an #IDEA
        - IMAGINE: an #IDEA forming in your #MIND
        - IMAGINE: writing down that #IDEA

        - IMAGINE: that #IDEA becomes a #STORY
        - IMAGINE: all the ways you can bring the #IDEA into #REALITY
        - IMAGINE: the #IDEA #MANIFESTING

        - IMAGINE: discovering the #TIME needed to compelte the #IDEA
        - IMAGINE: ignoring the #EXCUSES of your #LIFE for the #IDEA

        - IMAGINE: #NonProgrammers all over the world start having #IDEAS
        - IMAGINE: we thank the #PROGRAMMERS and #AI for helping us with #IDEAS.

        - IMAGINE: We learn to #COMMUNICATE our ideas to one another.
        - just #IMAGINE...

  - #STEPS: The steps of development
    - A: #DUMMIES
      - MAKE: a FOR-DUMMIES edition of #IDEA
        - NOTE: This version would be as if they were being explained to a five
        year old. By making a video/text explaining them in the simplest form
        possible.

      - MAKE: Develop Information Messages from #IDEA.
        - NOTE: The options below are possible locations to seed your #MAKE messages.

        - INSTAGRAM: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
        - OTHER: Any other #UNKNOWN social networks

    - B: #MESSENGERS
        - WHEN: the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist
        #FAMILY and #FREIENDS inviting them to observe/watch the #IDEA.

        - NOTE: To make this process easier the message could be started on subjects
        that are already prone to the idea.

    - C: #ENGAGEMENT
      - WHEN: both the #MESSENGERS and the #IDEA are ready an awareness
      marathon will start with #MESSENGERS posting the previously prepared
      (general public) messages.

      #MESSENGERS could:
        - replace their normal profile with the a #BANNER
        - use common #HASHTAGS
        - encouraged to #SHARE the #IDEA

      - NOTE: The message should be crystal clear as well as the intentions

  - #WHO: are the NonProgrammers
    - SOMEONE: who is low in technical-skill.
    - SOMEONE: who is is disinterested in the inner-workings of technology.
    - SOMEONE: who reads romance novels over code novels.
    - SOMEONE: who has no #IDEA what an #API is.
    - SOMEONE: who needs help learning out #TECHNOLOGY.
    - SOMEONE: who is learning about #TECHNOLOGY.
    - SOMEONE: who has yet to write a #HelloWorld
    - SOMEONE: who is learning as they go.
