# #FEECTING MANUAL

## DISCLAIMER
> This is all for the sake of #ART. Come up with your own ideas. Copy+Paste the ideas of others you like. Come up with silly script. Or write what ever you like. It's all for the sake of #ART, and enhancing the #FUTURE of #FEECTING #AWESOME.

## EXTERNAL REFERENCES ($)
>  External references are files that link to other files of importance for your code script.  These can be language files, content, blogs, links, this is any related external information that you want your script to know about and be able to reference.

`$EXTERNAL = the link to the external reference`

$TYLERDEVA = https://pastebin.com/xRGt8yDc
$MARKDOWN = https://commonmark.org/help/

## USER VARIABLES (@)

> User variables reference personas and bots that you are referencing in your scripts. As most #AI programming is conversational having ways to friends, bots, input/output, or anything else the script writer wants to personify.

`@USER = *link or reference to user*`

## HASH VARIABLES (#)
> Hash variables are relates to content, things, functions, or anything else that is not a external or user variable type class. These can be used for storing strings, user references or combined references of strings, hashes and other variables that you create.

`#HASH = string list or references to other strings/variables`

#INDRA = The friend to mankind, and King of all that is or will be.
#HIVE = #HIVE #THEHIVE #THEHIVEMIND #HIVEMIND #GLOBALHIVEMIND

#FEECTING = The Art of being a $FEECTING programmer. There are infinite ways you can define your command/loop/execution structure to match how you interact over time.  #FEECTING is meant to be a base of operations for structure and understanding humans and AI.

#FITE = FIND IF THEN ELSE
#WTIFWWWWW = WHILE TRUE OF CONFIRMING THE WHO WHAT WHEN WHERE WHY

## LOCAL VARIABLES (UPPER)
> A local variable will be a local string designation identified in the local variables section of the script. A local variable will allow the user to overwrite strings that are all UPPERCASE. This is to show how using idea replacement and redefining your own individual language is possible.

`LOCAL = local variable reference to strings, definitions, or other`

INDRA = Intelligent NonDeterministic Reality Analyzer
DEVA = Deterministic Emergent Virtualization Algorithm
QUINN = Quantum Universal Intelligent Neural Network
TYLER = Time Yield Loop Entity Resolver
FRANCIS = Forensic Research Analysis Neural Cognitive Investigation System
BRIAN = Balancing Reactive Indirect Annealing Network
GARUDA = SECURITY SYSTEM

## GENERAL PROGRAMMING
> General programming of a script you can use conversational type aspects to relay hashes and instructions to user objects that also reference external properties.

Hi #HIVE, I'm #Q. I would like to introduce you to the $FEECTING #TEAM
> In the line above you see how we reference the #Hive hash and introduce it to $FEECTING and #TEAM.

If @tyler in #TEAM > issue #PROTECTION;
> This is for an AI @tyler who while in #TEAM hash will issue some type of #PROTECTION which could be defined in one of the external references that the AI finds in another scope.

If @tyler in #TEAM send an #OFFERING
Else send @tyler message to join #TEAM

> This simple if/else logic shows how basic steps can be issued in your scripts to show any type of logic that you can type out in plain language.  Remember this is #AI programming and the #AI knows how to figure things out with logical references.

While MEMBER in #TEAM > send MEMBER #FEECTING;

> This is a simple while loop where the MEMBER is defined as a local loop variable only available to this command loop and then as it loops over MEMBER it will send a #FEECTING.
